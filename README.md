# 📌 Flutter Todo App with Cubit & Database Integration  

A powerful Todo List application built using **Flutter** with **Cubit** for state management and **SQLite** for persistent data storage. This app offers a seamless way to manage and track tasks efficiently.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Add new tasks with a title and description  
✅ Mark tasks as **completed** or **pending** (Dynamic Colors: 🟩 Green for completed, 🟥 Red for pending)  
✅ Efficient state management using **Cubit**  
✅ Store todos in a local **SQLite** database  
✅ Smooth UI updates with **Cubit**'s state control  
✅ Uses **ListView.builder** for dynamic rendering  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🔹 **Flutter (Dart)** — For building the UI and logic  
🔹 **Cubit** — For efficient and scalable state management  
🔹 **SQLite (via sqflite package)** — For storing and managing data locally  

## 📋 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Add Tasks** — Users can easily add tasks with details.  
2️⃣ **Track Progress** — Each task's status is dynamically updated using Cubit.  
3️⃣ **Persistent Storage** — All data is securely stored in an SQLite database to ensure no data loss.  

## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions  
🔹 **Cubit Implementation** — Ensured smooth state transitions by correctly managing `emit()` states.  
🔹 **Database Integration** — Used optimized queries for faster data retrieval and updates.
